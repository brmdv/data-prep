# Data preprocessing practice



## New York City Car crashes

This is the first data set. 
It contains data about car crashes in New York City. 
The [goal]() of this exercise is to clean up the data using Pandas, and prepare it 

In order to inspect the data and develop my cleaning method, I used a Jupyter **Notebook**. 
It can be read to flollow my thought process.
Then I collected all the thing I did in one **script** _crashes.py_, that can be used to clean an arbitray csv file (of the same format).

```
python crash.py INPUT.csv OUTPUT.csv
```
