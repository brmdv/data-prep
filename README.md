# Data preprocessing practice



## New York City Car crashes

This is the first data set. 
It contains data about car crashes in New York City. 
The goal of [this exercise](https://github.com/becodeorg/ANT-Theano-2-27/blob/main/4.machine_learning/projects/0.data_preprocessing/1.nyc_crashes.md) is to clean up the data using Pandas, and prepare it for machine learning.

In order to inspect the data and develop my cleaning process, I used a Jupyter **Notebook**, which can be read to follow my thought process.
Then I collected all the steps I took in one **script** <crashes.py>, that can be used to clean an arbitrary csv file (of the same format).  
I haven't built in any safety checks, so be careful not to overwrite any files.

```
python crash.py INPUT.csv OUTPUT.csv
```
